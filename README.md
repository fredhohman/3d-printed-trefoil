## Exploring 3D Printing in Topology
At the University of Georgia I spent three semesters exploring 3D printing techniques in topology under [Dr. David Gay][dg] in the [Mathematics Department][ugamath], in particular, visualizing complex shapes and knots using a MakerBot Replicator 2. 

Here's the [project page][project].

My project involved programming, generating, and manipulating variations of the open-book decomposition of the complement of the trefoil knot in Mathematica to create a "3D printed puzzle" made of multiple pieces that hold together via small magnets. 

After completing the project and 3D printing the final puzzle, I wrote my undergraduate thesis titled ["3D Printing the Trefoil Knot and its Pages"][thesis] and gave a talk at the [2015 UGA CURO Symposium][curo2015].

I also took pictures of some of the configurations of the puzzle which can be seen below.

You can download my models from [my Thingiverse profile][thingiverse] to 3D print for yourself.
